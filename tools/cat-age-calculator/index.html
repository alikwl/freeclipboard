    <h2>Cat Age Calculator - Find Your Cat's Human Age</h2>
    <p>Ever wondered how old your cat really is in human years? It's not as simple as multiplying by 7! Cats age much faster in their first two years of life, then slow down considerably. Our Cat Age Calculator uses the most accurate veterinary formula to convert your cat's age to human years, giving you a true understanding of your feline friend's life stage.</p>
    
    <p>Whether you have a playful kitten, an energetic adult, or a wise senior cat, knowing their equivalent human age helps you provide better care, understand their behavior, and appreciate each stage of their life. Plus, it's fun to share with fellow cat lovers!</p>
    
    <h2>How to Use the Cat Age Calculator</h2>
    <p>Using our calculator is incredibly simple—just three easy steps:</p>
    
    <div class="how-to-steps">
      <div class="step-item">
        <div class="step-number">1</div>
        <div class="step-content">
          <h3>Enter Your Cat's Age</h3>
          <p>Input your cat's age in years using the first field. If your cat is less than a year old, just enter 0 in the years field. The calculator handles ages from newborn kittens to elderly cats over 20 years old.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="step-item">
        <div class="step-number">2</div>
        <div class="step-content">
          <h3>Add Additional Months (Optional)</h3>
          <p>For more accuracy, especially with younger cats, add any additional months. For example, if your cat is 2 years and 6 months old, enter "2" in years and "6" in months. This gives you a more precise human age equivalent.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="step-item">
        <div class="step-number">3</div>
        <div class="step-content">
          <h3>See the Results Instantly</h3>
          <p>The calculator automatically shows your cat's age in human years, their life stage (kitten, adult, senior, etc.), and a cute cat emoji that changes based on their age. You can also share the result with friends using the share button!</p>
        </div>

    </div>
    
    <h2>Understanding Cat Years vs Human Years</h2>
    <p>The old myth of "multiply by 7" doesn't accurately reflect how cats age. Here's the real science:</p>
    
    <div class="info-cards">
      <div class="info-card">
        <h3>🐱 First Year</h3>
        <p>A cat's first year is equivalent to about 15 human years. During this time, they grow from helpless kittens to fully developed young adults. It's an incredible transformation!</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="info-card">
        <h3>🐈 Second Year</h3>
        <p>The second year adds about 9 human years, bringing a 2-year-old cat to roughly 24 in human years. By now, they're fully mature and have developed their adult personality.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="info-card">
        <h3>🐈‍⬛ Each Year After</h3>
        <p>From year 3 onwards, each cat year equals approximately 4 human years. This is when the aging process becomes more consistent and predictable.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Cat Life Stages Explained</h2>
    <p>Understanding your cat's life stage helps you provide appropriate care:</p>
    
    <ul class="life-stages-list">
      <li><strong>Kitten (0-1 year):</strong> Rapid growth, high energy, learning social skills. Needs frequent meals, lots of play, and early veterinary care including vaccinations.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Young Adult (1-2 years):</strong> Peak physical condition, very active and playful. May still have kitten-like behavior but with adult strength and size.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Adult (3-6 years):</strong> Prime of life, established personality, stable energy levels. Generally healthy with routine veterinary care.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Mature Adult (7-10 years):</strong> Still active but may start slowing down slightly. More prone to weight gain. Regular health checkups become more important.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Senior (11-14 years):</strong> Noticeable decrease in activity, may develop age-related health issues. Needs special senior cat food and more frequent vet visits.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Geriatric (15+ years):</strong> Elderly cats requiring extra care, comfort, and medical attention. Many health issues may arise, but with proper care, cats can thrive well into their late teens and even twenties!</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Why Cat Age Matters</h2>
    <p>Knowing your cat's equivalent human age isn't just interesting—it's practical:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Better Healthcare:</strong> Understanding their life stage helps you recognize age-appropriate health concerns and schedule proper veterinary care.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Appropriate Diet:</strong> Kittens, adults, and seniors have different nutritional needs. Feeding age-appropriate food keeps your cat healthy.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Activity Levels:</strong> Knowing if your cat is a "teenager" or "middle-aged" helps you understand their energy levels and play needs.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Behavioral Understanding:</strong> Many behaviors make more sense when you know your cat's life stage. A "teenage" cat might be more rebellious!</li>
      
      <li><strong>Life Expectancy:</strong> Understanding where your cat is in their lifespan helps you cherish every moment and plan for their future care.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Indoor vs Outdoor Cats</h2>
    <p>It's worth noting that indoor cats typically live longer than outdoor cats. Indoor cats often reach 15-20 years or more, while outdoor cats average 2-5 years due to dangers like traffic, predators, and disease. Our calculator works for both, but remember that lifestyle significantly impacts longevity!</p>
    
    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    <div class="faq-section">
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is the "multiply by 7" rule accurate?</h3>
        <p>No! This is an old myth that doesn't reflect how cats actually age. Cats age much faster in their first two years (reaching 24 human years by age 2), then age more slowly afterward (about 4 human years per cat year). Our calculator uses the accurate veterinary formula.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How long do cats typically live?</h3>
        <p>Indoor cats typically live 12-18 years, with many reaching their early 20s. The oldest recorded cat lived to 38 years! Outdoor cats have shorter lifespans (2-5 years) due to environmental dangers. Proper care, nutrition, and regular vet visits can help your cat live a long, healthy life.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>At what age is a cat considered senior?</h3>
        <p>Cats are generally considered seniors at 11 years old (equivalent to about 60 human years). However, many cats remain active and healthy well into their senior years. Senior cats need more frequent vet checkups and may benefit from senior-specific food and supplements.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do different cat breeds age differently?</h3>
        <p>While the basic aging formula applies to all cats, some breeds do have different average lifespans. For example, Siamese and Burmese cats often live longer (15-20+ years), while larger breeds like Maine Coons may have slightly shorter lifespans (12-15 years). However, individual health and care matter more than breed.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How can I help my cat live longer?</h3>
        <p>Keep your cat indoors, provide high-quality food, maintain a healthy weight, ensure regular veterinary care (including dental), keep them mentally stimulated with play and enrichment, and give them lots of love! Spaying/neutering also contributes to longer lifespans.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why do cats age faster in their first two years?</h3>
        <p>Cats reach sexual maturity and full physical development much faster than humans. By 6 months, a cat is already a "teenager," and by 2 years, they're fully mature adults. This rapid early development is why the first two years count for so many human years.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is my 10-year-old cat really that old?</h3>
        <p>A 10-year-old cat is equivalent to a 56-year-old human—definitely middle-aged but not elderly! Many cats at this age are still quite active and healthy. With proper care, they have many good years ahead of them.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Should I change my cat's care based on their age?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Kittens need frequent meals and lots of play. Adult cats need routine care and weight management. Senior cats benefit from softer food, more frequent vet visits, easier access to litter boxes, and extra warmth and comfort. Adjust care as your cat ages.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I use this calculator for kittens?</h3>
        <p>Yes! The calculator works for cats of all ages, from newborn kittens to elderly cats. For very young kittens (under 6 months), the month input is especially important for accuracy since they age so rapidly during this period.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What if I don't know my cat's exact age?</h3>
        <p>If you adopted a cat and don't know their exact age, your veterinarian can estimate it based on teeth condition, eye clarity, coat quality, and overall physical condition. Even an approximate age helps you understand their life stage and care needs.</p>
