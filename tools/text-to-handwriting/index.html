    <h2>Text to Handwriting Converter</h2>
    <p>Ever wished you could turn your typed text into beautiful handwriting without picking up a pen? That's exactly what our Text to Handwriting Converter does! Whether you're a student looking to submit handwritten assignments, someone who wants to add a personal touch to letters, or just curious about how your words would look in different handwriting styles, this tool has you covered.</p>

    <div class="advanced-features">
      <div class="feature-detail">
        <h3>Random Letter Variation</h3>
        <p>This clever feature adds subtle variations to each letter, making your text look more natural and less "computer-generated." It's like how your handwriting isn't perfectly identical every time you write the same letter. Enable this for the most realistic results.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="feature-detail">
        <h3>Custom Spacing Controls</h3>
        <p>Fine-tune the space between letters and words to match your preferred writing style. Tight spacing for a compact look, or generous spacing for an airy, easy-to-read feel. You can even adjust line spacing to prevent text from looking cramped.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="feature-detail">
        <h3>Text Alignment Options</h3>
        <p>Choose how your text aligns on the page—left, center, right, or justified. This is especially useful when creating formal documents or artistic pieces where alignment matters.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="feature-detail">
        <h3>Shadow Effects</h3>
        <p>Add a subtle shadow to your text for depth and dimension. It's a small touch that can make your handwriting look more three-dimensional and realistic, especially when printed.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="feature-detail">
        <h3>Multiple Paper Styles</h3>
        <p>Beyond plain white, choose from lined paper (perfect for assignments), grid paper (great for technical notes), dotted paper (ideal for bullet journaling), or vintage paper (adds character to letters and creative projects).</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="feature-detail">
        <h3>Zoom and Preview</h3>
        <p>Use the zoom controls to inspect your handwriting up close before downloading. This helps you catch any spacing issues or make final adjustments to ensure everything looks perfect.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    <div class="faq-section">
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is this tool really free to use?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! The Text to Handwriting Converter is 100% free with no hidden charges, subscriptions, or premium features locked behind a paywall. We believe great tools should be accessible to everyone. Use it as much as you want, download unlimited files, and enjoy all features without spending a penny.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I use this for school assignments?</h3>
        <p>While our tool can convert text to handwriting, we encourage you to check with your teacher or professor first. Some educators have specific policies about digitally generated handwriting. That said, many students use it for legitimate purposes like creating neat copies of their handwritten notes or preparing study materials. When in doubt, ask your instructor!</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Will my text be stored on your servers?</h3>
        <p>Nope! This is one of our favorite features. Everything happens entirely in your browser—your text never leaves your device. We don't see it, we don't store it, and we can't access it. Your privacy is completely protected. Once you close the browser tab, it's gone forever (unless you saved it, of course!).</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What file formats can I download?</h3>
        <p>You have three options: download as a PNG image (great for inserting into documents or sharing online), download as a PDF (perfect for printing or submitting assignments), or copy directly to your clipboard (super convenient for quick pasting). Choose whichever format works best for your needs!</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How realistic does the handwriting look?</h3>
        <p>Pretty darn realistic! We use authentic handwriting fonts and offer features like random letter variation to make it look natural. While it won't fool a handwriting expert, it looks convincingly handwritten for most purposes. The key is choosing the right style and enabling random variation for the most authentic results.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I use this on my phone or tablet?</h3>
        <p>Yes! The tool is fully responsive and works beautifully on all devices. Whether you're on an iPhone, Android phone, iPad, or any tablet, you'll get the full experience. The interface adapts to your screen size, and all features remain accessible. Create handwritten text wherever you are!</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is there a limit to how much text I can convert?</h3>
        <p>You can convert up to 10,000 characters at once, which is roughly 1,500-2,000 words—plenty for most documents! If you need to convert more, simply break it into sections and create multiple files. This limit helps ensure the tool runs smoothly and generates high-quality output.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why does my downloaded image look pixelated?</h3>
        <p>If your image looks pixelated, try increasing the text size before downloading. Larger text creates higher resolution images. Also, make sure you're downloading as PNG (not copying and pasting), as PNG maintains the best quality. If you're printing, a text size of 18-20px usually works great.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I change the handwriting style after I've typed my text?</h3>
        <p>Of course! That's the beauty of this tool. Type your text once, then experiment with different styles, colors, and settings as much as you want. The preview updates instantly, so you can try different combinations until you find the perfect look. No need to retype anything!</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What's the difference between the handwriting styles?</h3>
        <p>Each style has its own personality! Casual Script is relaxed and friendly (great for personal notes), Elegant Cursive is flowing and formal (perfect for invitations), Print Style is clear and legible (ideal for assignments), Bold Script is confident and eye-catching (good for titles), and Neat Handwriting is organized and tidy (excellent for professional documents). Try them all to see which fits your needs!</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Does this work offline?</h3>
        <p>After your first visit, most of the tool works offline! The fonts need to be loaded initially (which requires internet), but once they're cached in your browser, you can use the tool without an internet connection. Perfect for working on the go or in areas with spotty WiFi.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I print directly from the tool?</h3>
        <p>Yes! There's a print button that opens a print-friendly version of your handwritten text. It removes all the controls and buttons, showing just your handwritten content. This makes it easy to print exactly what you need without any extra clutter on the page.</p>
